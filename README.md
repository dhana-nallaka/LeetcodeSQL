LeetcodeSQL â€“ Track My SQL Progress
Welcome to LeetcodeSQL! This repository is a personal project dedicated to tracking my journey towards mastering SQL. Each day, I challenge myself with SQL problems to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of relational databases, query optimization, and data manipulation. The problems here range from beginner to advanced, and they represent my ongoing commitment to becoming proficient in SQL.

ðŸš€ Why This Repository?
A Daily SQL Practice Log: Every new problem and solution is a reflection of my daily SQL practice. This repository is designed not only to track my progress but to push my limits in solving SQL problems. From basic SELECT statements to complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and window functions, every entry reflects a step forward in improving my SQL proficiency.

Step-by-Step Learning: The solutions in this repository come with clear explanations, so I can revisit each approach, refine my techniques, and track my growth over time. It's more than just writing queriesâ€”it's about learning to think critically, solving real-world problems, and optimizing queries for performance.

Commitment to Continuous Improvement: Iâ€™m dedicated to solving at least one new SQL problem every day. As I solve these problems, I refine my understanding of core SQL concepts and continuously push my boundaries.

ðŸ“ˆ Tracking My Progress
This repository serves as my SQL journal, where I log the following:

New concepts learned with each problem solved (e.g., new functions, techniques, or strategies).

Improved problem-solving strategies over time (e.g., moving from brute force solutions to more elegant and optimized queries).

Refinements and optimizations on past solutions, where I revisit older problems to improve performance or readability.

Challenges faced in certain problems and how I overcame them (e.g., complex joins, nested queries, etc.).

ðŸ§  SQL Topics I'm Mastering
Throughout this repository, I am tackling a wide variety of SQL topics, improving my skills in the following areas:

Basic Querying:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT

Grouping and Aggregating Data (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Joins and Relationships:

INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER JOIN

Self-joins, Cross Joins, and Union Operations

Advanced Queries:

Subqueries (nested SELECTs)

Complex Aggregations with GROUP BY and HAVING

Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), PARTITION BY)

Data Manipulation:

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Upsert and Data Cleansing techniques

Performance Optimization:

Query optimization for large datasets

Indexing strategies and query plans

Optimizing joins and reducing query execution time

Advanced Concepts:

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Recursive Queries

Transaction Control (ACID principles)

Database normalization and denormalization

ðŸ“Š Repository Milestones & Stats
Iâ€™m tracking my daily progress here, with the following milestones:

Total Problems Solved: [Number of problems solved]

Current Focus Area: [E.g., Joins, Subqueries, Performance Optimization]

SQL Mastery Level: [Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced]

Each day I reflect on my SQL journey and aim to move to the next level, refining both the quality and efficiency of my code.

ðŸ’¡ How This Repository Benefits Me
Continuous Learning: By working on Leetcode SQL problems daily, I not only expand my SQL knowledge but also build my problem-solving abilities, making me more versatile as a data professional.

Revisiting and Refining Old Problems: This repository serves as a reference point where I revisit and improve on my past solutions. It's an opportunity to review my previous mistakes, optimize queries, and deepen my understanding of SQL concepts.

Tracking Progress and Growth: Over time, I can visually see how my SQL skills have evolvedâ€”from solving simple queries to tackling more complex problems involving window functions, recursive queries, and optimization.
